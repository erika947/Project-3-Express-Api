# Genshin Impact Api Backend
What I wanted to do with my backend it be able to create two database schemas that will allow for the user to browse the website for different info base on the character or weapon they selected.

## Base URL link:
This is the data and routes that are going to be used in our frontend application. this is the link that will lead you to the info that is used in these pages:
* https://genshin-api-erika.herokuapp.com/todos | Character Database
* https://genshin-api-erika.herokuapp.com/todos/weapons | Weapons Database
